                                <p>Hunderend textbooks, thousands of journals, Millions of articles had discussed the most important aspect of marketing and how to sell products. Of all of those millions of information the foremost important essence of marketing is simply <b>empathy.</b></p>

                                <p>Humans are a social creature, They want to have a personal bond with the brands they associate themselves with like theyâ€™re being cared about by someone close to them like relatives or friends. A good business or product function is to help their customer in a certain activity, to asset their life or make them feel good. We need to be as human as possible in the marketing aspect so that we get that bond with the customer to the brand themself. Humanizing your advertising builds confidence. It taps into the emotions of individuals, and research shows that this is one of the most important elements of the buyer's journey's decision-making process.</p>
                                
                                <p>To put ourself in the shoe of the customer, know what their beliefs, their inside joke, their niche preferences. It's much easier if you yourself are one of the targeted customers but that doesn't mean that you have to be, you could always research, ask the target, and ask yourself if I were them what would I do?</p>

                                <p>Few of the general and important tips in most marketing is that first and foremost is that brands need to talk like an actual person in the aspect of digital and traditional marketing.

                                    <h4>Where we come from and the current situation ?</h4>
                                    <p>I started designing for the web in 2011 and working in 2013. One of my first jobs was at
                                        Microsoft as an intern in their design team located in Helsinki. At that time most of
                                        the resources for UI were made in Photoshop. Yes, Photoshop, a tool for editing photos
                                        was the same for designing web pages. Using this tool, I could export images that were
                                        passed to development and they would do all the magic to bringing it to life through
                                        code. But, they didn't coded it as I expected them to do. The design never fit exactly
                                        what I had designed and it frustrated me, a lot. I didn't understand it, so I decided to
                                        learn how to code frontend, to understand what the problem was and how it could get it
                                        solved.</p>
