                                <p>There are a lot of preconceptions that artists are similar to a graphic designer. And there are tons of designers that are wishing to be an artist someday. For them to express themself in their arts, but there are different approaches to those two job titles.</p>
                                
                                <br>
                                <h3>By definition</h3>
                                
                                <p>An artist's creation needs to provoke people's emotion to have a different interpretation from each art that they created. Artist is all about self expression and could be as simple as a banana that is taped to a wall or a fifteen feet of a goddess sculpture. Art is the subjective, human representation of ideas, feelings and events conveyed by aesthetic means like painting, sculpture, drawing, photography, ceramics and more.</p>
                                
                                <p>A designer's job is to send a clear message to the targeted market. Its main focus is functionality and commercial use. Design requires both visually and communicating concepts and impressions through pictures, phrases or graphics. In posters, commercials, packages, novels, magazines and brand names for enterprises, designers tell a story.</p>
                                
                                <p>Even Though there are similarities to the medium and the use of creativity those occupations use, they have very different minds of approach and function of those items that they created. And even so tons of designers are artists in their spare time.</p>

                                <h3>What makes designer special?</h3>
                                
                                <p>Designers need to know or predict how the audience will react to the piece that they created. If someone needs to explain to them the meaning of the designer creation that means the designer has failed. Designers need to know to whom the target is and how usually the target is a custom to consume their information. To accommodate the business goals, to capture the audience's attention, And to motivate them to do an action that benefits both the company and the audience themselves. Those goals can be obtained by using the designers skill or problem solving skills to accommodate and serve the target audience.</p>

                                    <h4>Where we come from and the current situation ?</h4>
                                    <p>I started designing for the web in 2011 and working in 2013. One of my first jobs was at
                                        Microsoft as an intern in their design team located in Helsinki. At that time most of
                                        the resources for UI were made in Photoshop. Yes, Photoshop, a tool for editing photos
                                        was the same for designing web pages. Using this tool, I could export images that were
                                        passed to development and they would do all the magic to bringing it to life through
                                        code. But, they didn't coded it as I expected them to do. The design never fit exactly
                                        what I had designed and it frustrated me, a lot. I didn't understand it, so I decided to
                                        learn how to code frontend, to understand what the problem was and how it could get it
                                        solved.</p>
